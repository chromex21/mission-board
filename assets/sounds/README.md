# Sound Assets

This directory contains sound effects for the Mission Board app.

## Required Sound Files

The following MP3 files need to be added to this directory:

- `mission_accepted.mp3` - Plays when a worker accepts a mission
- `mission_completed.mp3` - Plays when a worker completes a mission
- `level_up.mp3` - Plays when a user levels up
- `new_message.mp3` - Plays when receiving a direct message
- `notification.mp3` - General notification sound
- `achievement.mp3` - Plays when earning an achievement
- `error.mp3` - Plays on error actions
- `success.mp3` - Plays on successful actions

## Recommendations

- Keep files under 100KB each for fast loading
- Use MP3 format for best browser compatibility
- Sample rate: 44.1kHz or 48kHz
- Bit rate: 128kbps or higher

## Note

Until actual sound files are added, the sound system will fail silently (no error will be thrown to users).
